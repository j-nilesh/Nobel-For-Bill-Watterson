  <p>On pretty much any parameter you can think of, the reclusive genius has made contributionas to the world of art and literarute that are simply outstanding. It's about time that Bill Waterson got the Nobel prize for Literature for his outstanding
    work in creating the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip.</p>

  <h3>Key reasons why Bill Watterson deserves a Nobel</h3>
  <p>For those who are fans of Calvin and Hobbes, it almost seems silly to discuss why Bill Watterson deserves a nobel, but the argument perhaps needs, perhaps because of the domain he operated in. The way Bob Dylan's Nobel was panned in some
    quarters..</p>

    <li>He took the comic strip art form to a new level</li>
    <li>The Calvin and Hobbes series makes commentary on key issues, including:
      <ol>
        <li>Environment</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.bobcatterritory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/polls.gif">Politics</a></li>

        <li>Art</li>
        <li>Childhood</li>
        <li>Education</li>
      </ol>
    <li>Successive generations have discovered and fallen in love with C&H, and the lgecay continues to endure.</li>
    <li>Most importantly perhaps, Bill Watterson is so reclusive and so rarely interviewed or even seen in public, that conferring him a Nobel is perhaps the only way to get him out of hiding, and this is honestly would be putting a NObel to a pretty
      decent use for once.</li>
